\usage{
cart_split(y, x, epsilon)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{Outcome variable}

\item{x}{Explanatory variable}

\item{epsilon}{Parameter that dictates how close the trends between two groups needs to be for PTA to be considered valid
For example, we will consider that PTA holds in regions where beta_1 - beta_0 <= epsilon}
}
\description{
This code is adapted from the vignette in https://github.com/cran/rpart/blob/master/tests/usersplits.R
The only thing we change from that example is the splitting function (stemp), which is the focus of our approach
For more details on the other functions and rpart more generally, check the vignette and package documentation
